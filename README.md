## Projects

* #### Hospital App
  A Hospital management application created for both doctors and patients.  Patients are able to manage their medical history, schedule appointments, and contact their doctor among other things.  Doctors are able to check patient history, create a new patient in the system, and view patient services.  Currently, data within the application writes to vectors and arrays, but information was initially intended to be stored within a database.
 
  This was a project for a Software Engineering class in which I collaborated with 3 others to get it done within a short time frame.  Mockups for the initial concept are available for view within the directory.

* #### MenuBook
  A menubook organization applet that allows the user to create new menus, add new recipes, select and add new ingredients to menus, and create a series of steps necessary for each menu item.  Generated output is displayed within the textbox.

## Socket Programming

* #### Group Messaging App - Communicator
  A Simple chat client that runs on the server and allows many clients to join in.  Each client creates a username that gets displayed with each message written to the chat room.  

  Currently, the GUI is just a text field and a text box, with the user name creation appearing within an Option popup.

* #### TCPclient & TCPserver
Basic client server programs using TCP methodology to create a socket connection between two computers.  This is a one way socket connection in which the client can send messages that are then displayed on the server side.

* #### TCPmulticlient & TCPmultiserver
A multi user chat application that is similar to the Group Messaging app - Communicator, but is solely command line based.  This version lacks separate user names

* #### UDPclient & UDPserver
