# Java Projects & Files

>This repo contains a collection of Java files and projects that were used to learn the language.  Some files were part of assignments that were done for classes, others are just small projects I accomplished on the side.

## Projects

* #### Hospital App
 A Hospital management application created for both doctors and patients.  This was a project for a Software Engineering class in which I collaborated with 3 others to get done within a short time frame. Patients are able to manage their medical history, schedule appointments, and contact their doctor among other things.  Doctors are able to check patient history, create a new patient in the system, and view patient services.  Currently, data within the application writes to vectors and arrays, but information was initially intended to be stored within a database.
 
  Mockups for the initial idea are available for view within the directory.
